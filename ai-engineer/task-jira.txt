[UI] UI-kit. Reflect the latest components changes in the ui-kit
After the last ui-kit update, some components (e.g. buttons, checkboxes) have been updated in the UI core. Since ui-kit is still not integrated in the application, we need to reflect the changes from the core in the ui-kit components.

The following changes need to be included (please also refer to the relevant Jira tickets):
