# main.tf
## Overview
The `main.tf` file is a Terraform configuration file. Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure resources in a declarative way. The `main.tf` file is typically the main entry point for a Terraform project and defines the resources that will be created or managed.

In this specific `main.tf` file, there is a resource block defined for creating an Azure resource group. The resource group is a logical container for resources deployed in Azure. The `azurerm_resource_group` resource block specifies the desired name and location for the resource group.

## Prerequisites
To use this `main.tf` file, you need the following prerequisites:
- Terraform installed on your local machine
- Azure CLI installed and configured with appropriate credentials

## Usage
To utilize this `main.tf` file in a project, follow these steps:
1. Create a new Terraform project or navigate to an existing project directory.
2. Copy the `main.tf` file into the project directory.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Initialize Terraform by running the command `terraform init`.
5. Optionally, review and modify the values in the `main.tf` file to match your desired resource group configuration.
6. Apply the changes by running the command `terraform apply`.

## Methods
The `main.tf` file does not contain any methods or functions. It defines a single resource using the Terraform configuration language.

## Useful details
The `main.tf` file is typically used as the main configuration file for a Terraform project. It defines the desired state of the infrastructure resources to be provisioned or managed. The example code in the `main.tf` file creates an Azure resource group in the "eastus" location.

It is important to note that the example code provided is a simplified version and may need to be modified or extended to meet the specific requirements of your project. Additionally, other resource blocks can be added to the `main.tf` file to define additional resources to be provisioned or managed by Terraform.
