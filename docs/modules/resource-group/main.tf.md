# main.tf
## Overview
The `main.tf` file is a Terraform configuration file used to define and manage Azure resource groups. It utilizes the `azurerm_resource_group` resource to create a resource group in the Azure cloud platform. The file plays a crucial role in provisioning and managing the infrastructure resources required for a software project in Azure.

## Prerequisites
To use the `main.tf` file, the following prerequisites are required:
- Terraform installed on the local machine
- Azure subscription and authentication credentials
- Azure CLI installed and configured

## Usage
To utilize the `main.tf` file in a project, follow these steps:
1. Install Terraform on your local machine.
2. Configure Azure CLI and authenticate with your Azure subscription.
3. Create a new directory for your Terraform project.
4. Create a file named `main.tf` in the project directory.
5. Copy the code from this document into the `main.tf` file.
6. Customize the code according to your project requirements.
7. Run the following commands in the project directory:
   ```
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

## Methods
The `main.tf` file defines a single resource block for creating an Azure resource group using the `azurerm_resource_group` resource. The resource block has the following parameters:

### azurerm_resource_group.rg
- `name`: (Required) The name of the resource group. This value is obtained from the `var.resource_group_name` variable.
- `location`: (Optional) The location/region where the resource group should be created. The default value is set to "eastus".

Example usage:
```terraform
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
  name     = var.resource_group_name
  location = "eastus"
}
```

## Useful details
- The `azurerm_resource_group` resource creates an Azure resource group in the specified location. A resource group is a logical container for resources in Azure.
- The `name` parameter should be unique within the Azure subscription.
- The `location` parameter determines the datacenter region where the resource group will be created.
