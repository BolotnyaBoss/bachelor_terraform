# main.tf
## Overview
The `main.tf` file is a Terraform configuration file that defines the Azure Resource Group resource. It is used to create an Azure resource group in the specified location.

The Azure Resource Group is a logical container for resources deployed on Azure. It helps in managing and organizing resources as a single entity.

This file plays a crucial role in a software project as it enables the creation and management of Azure resources using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.

## Prerequisites
To use this file, the following prerequisites must be met:
- Terraform must be installed on the local machine.
- Azure CLI must be installed and properly authenticated.
- Azure subscription and resource group must be set up.

## Usage
To create an Azure resource group using this configuration file, follow these steps:

1. Set up the necessary Azure authentication by running the following command:
   ```
   az login
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the `main.tf` file.

3. Initialize the Terraform configuration by running the following command:
   ```
   terraform init
   ```

4. Review the configuration and ensure that the `var.resource_group_name` variable is set to the desired name for the resource group.

5. Apply the configuration to create the resource group by running the following command:
   ```
   terraform apply
   ```

   This will create the specified resource group in the "eastus" location.

## Methods
The `main.tf` file does not contain any methods or functions. It defines a Terraform resource using the `azurerm_resource_group` resource type.

### `azurerm_resource_group.rg`
This resource block defines the Azure Resource Group resource. It has the following parameters:

- `name`: Specifies the name of the resource group. This should be set using the `var.resource_group_name` variable.
- `location`: Specifies the Azure region where the resource group should be created. In this example, it is set to "eastus".

Example:
```terraform
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
  name     = var.resource_group_name
  location = "eastus"
}
```

## Useful details
- The `name` parameter should be unique within the Azure subscription.
- The `location` parameter determines the Azure region where the resource group will be created. Change it to the desired region as per your requirements.
- Additional configuration options are available for the `azurerm_resource_group` resource, such as tags, additional properties, etc. Refer to the official Terraform documentation for more details.
