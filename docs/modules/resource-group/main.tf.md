# main.tf
## Overview
The `main.tf` file is a Terraform configuration file that defines and provisions an Azure resource group. It uses the `azurerm_resource_group` resource type from the Azure Terraform provider to create the resource group in the specified Azure location.

This file plays a role in a software project by providing the infrastructure-as-code definition for managing Azure resource groups. It allows developers to define and manage resource groups as part of their application infrastructure, enabling them to easily provision and manage the necessary resources in Azure.

## Prerequisites
To use this file, the following prerequisites are required:

- Terraform: The Terraform CLI must be installed on the machine where the file is being executed. The version should be compatible with the `azurerm` provider version being used.

## Usage
To instantiate and utilize this file in a project, follow these steps:

1. Install Terraform: If Terraform is not already installed, download and install it from the official website.
2. Create a new directory for your Terraform project.
3. Create a file named `main.tf` in the project directory.
4. Copy the provided code into the `main.tf` file.
5. Set the value of the `var.resource_group_name` variable to the desired name for the resource group.
6. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
7. Run the following command to initialize the Terraform project:

```bash
terraform init
```

8. Run the following command to preview the changes that will be made:

```bash
terraform plan
```

9. If the plan looks correct, run the following command to apply the changes and create the resource group:

```bash
terraform apply
```

10. The resource group will be provisioned in the specified Azure location.

## Methods
This file does not contain any methods or functions. It only defines a Terraform resource block that creates an Azure resource group.

## Useful details
- The `name` parameter of the `azurerm_resource_group` resource block specifies the name of the resource group. It should be set using the `var.resource_group_name` variable, which can be defined in a separate variables file or passed as a command-line argument.
- The `location` parameter specifies the Azure region where the resource group will be created. In the provided code, it is set to "eastus", but it can be modified to any valid Azure region.
- The `azurerm_resource_group` resource block is provided by the `azurerm` Terraform provider. Make sure to have the correct version of the provider installed and configured in your Terraform project.
