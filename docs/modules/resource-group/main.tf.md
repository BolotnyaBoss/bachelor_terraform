4. [Useful details](#properties)

## Prerequisites
To use this file, you need to have the following dependencies installed:
- Terraform (version 0.12 or later)
- Azure CLI (version 2.0 or later)

## Usage
1. Make sure you have the prerequisites installed.
2. Create a new directory for your Terraform project.
3. Create the `main.tf` file and copy the code into it.
4. Customize the variables according to your needs.
5. Initialize the Terraform project by running the following command:
   ```
   terraform init
   ```
6. Deploy the resource group by running the following command:
   ```
   terraform apply
   ```
7. Confirm the changes and wait for the deployment to complete.

## Methods
The `main.tf` file contains the following method:

### azurerm_resource_group
This method is used to create an Azure resource group. It takes two parameters: `name` and `location`. The `name` parameter specifies the name of the resource group, while the `location` parameter specifies the Azure region where the resource group should be created.

Example:
```terraform
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
  name     = var.resource_group_name
  location = "eastus"
}
```

## Useful details
- The `name` parameter in the `azurerm_resource_group` method should be set to a unique name for your resource group.
- The `location` parameter should be set to the desired Azure region where you want to create the resource group.
- The actual value for `var.resource_group_name` should be provided either as a variable or directly in the code.
- This file represents just a small part of a larger Terraform project. Other files may be present to define additional Azure resources and their configurations.
