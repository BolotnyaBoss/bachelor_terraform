# outputs.tf
## Overview
The `outputs.tf` file is used to define and configure the outputs of a software project. It is typically used in infrastructure-as-code projects to expose information about the deployed resources.

In this specific example, the file defines two outputs: "name" and "location". These outputs retrieve information from an Azure Resource Group and provide the names and locations of the resource group.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use this `outputs.tf` file.

## Usage
To utilize this `outputs.tf` file, you need to have an existing Azure Resource Group defined in your project. The outputs defined in this file will retrieve the name and location of that resource group.

To instantiate and utilize the outputs, you can follow these steps:

1. Create an instance of the `azurerm_resource_group` resource block in your Terraform configuration file.
2. Specify the desired name and location for the resource group.
3. Reference the outputs in your project code using the `output` block.

## Methods
This `outputs.tf` file does not contain any methods or functions. It only defines the outputs using the `output` block.

The `output` block has the following structure:

```hcl
output "<output_name>" {
  value       = <value_expression>
  description = "<output_description>"
}
```

- `<output_name>`: The unique name for the output.
- `<value_expression>`: The expression that retrieves the desired value for the output.
- `<output_description>`: A brief description of the output.

In the provided code, there are two outputs defined:

1. `name`: Retrieves the name of the Azure Resource Group using the expression `azurerm_resource_group.rg.name`. The output description is "Resource Group name".
2. `location`: Retrieves the location of the Azure Resource Group using the expression `azurerm_resource_group.rg.location`. The output description is "Resource Group Azure region".

## Useful details
- The outputs defined in this file can be accessed by other parts of the project code to retrieve information about the deployed Azure Resource Group.
- The expressions used in the `value` attribute of the `output` block should reference the appropriate resources or variables defined in your Terraform configuration file.
- The values of the defined outputs can be accessed using the Terraform command `terraform output <output_name>`. For example, to retrieve the name of the resource group, you can run `terraform output name`.
