# outputs.tf
## Overview
The `outputs.tf` file is used to define the outputs of a Terraform module. It specifies the values that should be exposed to the user after the infrastructure is provisioned. This file is typically used in a Terraform project to provide information about the resources created or their attributes.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use the `outputs.tf` file. However, it assumes that the corresponding resource group (`azurerm_resource_group.rg`) has already been defined in the Terraform configuration.

## Usage
To use the `outputs.tf` file in a Terraform project, follow these steps:

1. Create a Terraform module or add the `outputs.tf` file to an existing module.
2. Define the desired outputs using the `output` block.
3. Specify the values to be exposed using the `value` parameter.
4. Optionally, provide a description for each output using the `description` parameter.

Here is an example of how the `outputs.tf` file can be used:

```terraform
output "name" {
  value       = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  description = "Resource Group name"
}

output "location" {
  value       = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
  description = "Resource Group Azure region"
}
```

In this example, two outputs are defined: `name` and `location`. The value of `name` is set to the `name` attribute of the `azurerm_resource_group.rg` resource, and the value of `location` is set to the `location` attribute of the same resource.

## Methods
The `outputs.tf` file does not contain any methods or functions. It is used solely for defining the outputs of a Terraform module.

## Useful details
- The outputs defined in the `outputs.tf` file can be accessed by other Terraform modules or scripts using the `terraform output` command.
- The outputs can also be used for reference or interpolation in other parts of the Terraform configuration, such as input variables or resource attributes.
- The value of each output can be any valid Terraform expression, allowing for complex computations or transformations if needed.
- The `description` parameter is optional but can be helpful for providing additional context or documentation for each output.
