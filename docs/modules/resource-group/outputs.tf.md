# outputs.tf
## Overview
The `outputs.tf` file is used to define and declare the outputs of a Terraform module. It specifies the values that should be exposed and made available to other parts of the infrastructure or to users of the module. 

In a Terraform project, a module is a reusable set of resources that can be instantiated multiple times with different input values. The `outputs.tf` file is used to define the outputs of these modules, allowing users to easily access and utilize the values produced by the module.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use the `outputs.tf` file.

## Usage
To utilize the `outputs.tf` file in a Terraform project, follow these steps:

1. Create or navigate to the directory where the `outputs.tf` file is located.
2. Define the desired outputs using the `output` block syntax.
3. Specify the value and description for each output.

For example, the following code snippet defines two outputs: `name` and `location`.

```terraform
output "name" {
  value       = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  description = "Resource Group name"
}

output "location" {
  value       = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
  description = "Resource Group Azure region"
}
```

## Methods
The `outputs.tf` file does not contain any methods or functions. It solely consists of `output` blocks that define the desired outputs.

## Useful details
- The `output` block syntax is used to define each output. It consists of the keyword `output`, followed by the output name, value, and description.
- The `value` attribute specifies the value of the output. It can reference other resources or variables in the Terraform project.
- The `description` attribute provides a human-readable description of the output.
- Outputs defined in the `outputs.tf` file can be accessed in other parts of the infrastructure or by users of the module using the `terraform output` command.
