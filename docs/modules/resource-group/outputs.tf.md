# outputs.tf
## Overview
The outputs.tf file is used in a project to define and declare the outputs of the infrastructure resources provisioned using Terraform. It is a part of the Terraform configuration that is responsible for creating and managing the infrastructure resources in cloud platforms like Azure, AWS, etc. The primary purpose of this file is to provide a way to access and display the important information about the provisioned resources.

## Prerequisites
To use the outputs.tf file, the following dependencies are required:
- Terraform: The version of Terraform should be compatible with the configuration.

## Usage
To utilize the outputs.tf file in a project, follow these steps:
1. Create a Terraform configuration file and include the outputs.tf file.
2. Define the outputs using the `output` block.
3. Specify the value and description for each output.
4. Use the outputs in other parts of the project as needed.

For example, the outputs.tf file can be used to define and display the name and location of a resource group provisioned in Azure:

```terraform
output "name" {
  value       = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  description = "Resource Group name"
}

output "location" {
  value       = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
  description = "Resource Group Azure region"
}
```

In the above example, the output block is used to define two outputs: "name" and "location". The value of each output is obtained from the corresponding resource group provisioned using the `azurerm_resource_group` resource. The description provides a brief explanation of each output.

## Methods
The outputs.tf file does not contain any methods or functions. It only defines the outputs using the `output` block. The `output` block has the following structure:

```terraform
output "<output_name>" {
  value       = <value_expression>
  description = "<output_description>"
}
```

- `<output_name>`: The name of the output.
- `<value_expression>`: The expression to obtain the value of the output. It can be a reference to a resource, data, or variable.
- `<output_description>`: A brief description of the output.

In the provided code, there are two output blocks defined: "name" and "location". The value of each output is obtained from the `azurerm_resource_group` resource and the description provides additional information about the outputs.

## Useful details
- The outputs defined in the outputs.tf file can be accessed using the Terraform command line or by referencing them in other parts of the Terraform configuration.
- The outputs provide a way to access and display important information about the provisioned resources, which can be useful for other parts of the project or for manual verification.
- The outputs.tf file is typically used in conjunction with the main Terraform configuration file to define and manage the infrastructure resources in a project.
