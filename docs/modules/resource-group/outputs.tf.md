# outputs.tf
## Overview
The `outputs.tf` file is used to define the outputs of a Terraform configuration. It allows users to specify the values they want to expose as outputs, which can be useful for other parts of the project or for external consumers. The file contains output blocks that define the name, value, and description of each output.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use the `outputs.tf` file.

## Usage
To define an output in the `outputs.tf` file, you need to specify the name, value, and description of the output using the following syntax:

```terraform
output "<output_name>" {
  value       = <value_expression>
  description = "<output_description>"
}
```

- `<output_name>`: The name of the output.
- `<value_expression>`: The expression that determines the value of the output. This can be a reference to a resource attribute or a computed value.
- `<output_description>`: A brief description of the output.

For example, the following code defines two outputs: "name" and "location":

```terraform
output "name" {
  value       = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  description = "Resource Group name"
}

output "location" {
  value       = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
  description = "Resource Group Azure region"
}
```

## Outputs
The `outputs.tf` file defines the following outputs:

1. **name**: Represents the name of the resource group.
   - Value: `azurerm_resource_group.rg.name`
   - Description: "Resource Group name"

2. **location**: Represents the Azure region of the resource group.
   - Value: `azurerm_resource_group.rg.location`
   - Description: "Resource Group Azure region"

These outputs can be referenced and used in other parts of the project or by external consumers.

## Useful details
- The outputs defined in `outputs.tf` are accessible via the Terraform state after the configuration has been applied.
- Outputs can be useful for retrieving information about deployed resources, such as their names, IP addresses, or connection strings.
- Outputs can be used in subsequent Terraform configurations by referencing them as input variables.
- Outputs can also be accessed using the Terraform CLI or API to retrieve information about the deployed infrastructure.
