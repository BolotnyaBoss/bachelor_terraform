# outputs.tf
## Overview
The `outputs.tf` file is used to define output variables in a Terraform configuration. Output variables are values that can be queried or accessed from outside of the configuration, such as by other configurations, scripts, or users.

In a Terraform project, the `outputs.tf` file plays the role of specifying the values that should be exposed as outputs. These outputs can be useful for providing information about the infrastructure that was created, sharing data between different configurations, or integrating with external systems.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use the `outputs.tf` file. However, it is assumed that Terraform is installed and configured properly on the system.

## Usage
To utilize the `outputs.tf` file, you need to define the output variables and specify their values. Each output variable is defined using the `output` keyword, followed by a unique name and a block of configuration.

Here is an example of how to define output variables in the `outputs.tf` file:

```terraform
output "name" {
  value       = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  description = "Resource Group name"
}

output "location" {
  value       = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
  description = "Resource Group Azure region"
}
```

In this example, two output variables named `name` and `location` are defined. The value of the `name` output variable is set to the `name` attribute of the `azurerm_resource_group.rg` resource, and the description is set to "Resource Group name". Similarly, the value of the `location` output variable is set to the `location` attribute of the `azurerm_resource_group.rg` resource, and the description is set to "Resource Group Azure region".

## Methods
There are no methods or functions in the `outputs.tf` file. It is used solely for defining output variables.

## Useful details
- The values of the output variables are evaluated when the Terraform configuration is applied.
- Output variables can be accessed using the `terraform output` command, which displays the values of the defined outputs.
- Output variables can also be used in other Terraform configurations by referencing them using the `module.<module_name>.<output_name>` syntax.
- The `description` attribute is optional and can be used to provide additional information about the output variable.
- Output variables can be of any data type supported by Terraform, including strings, numbers, lists, maps, and complex data structures.
