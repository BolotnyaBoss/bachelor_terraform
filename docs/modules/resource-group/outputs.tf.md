# outputs.tf
## Overview
The `outputs.tf` file is used to define the outputs of a Terraform configuration. It specifies the values that will be made available for other parts of the infrastructure to consume. This file plays a crucial role in a Terraform project as it allows users to expose specific information about the deployed resources.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use the `outputs.tf` file.

## Usage
To utilize the `outputs.tf` file in a Terraform project, follow these steps:
1. Create a new file named `outputs.tf` within your Terraform project.
2. Define the outputs using the `output` block.
3. Specify the value and description for each output.
4. Save the file.

## Methods
The `outputs.tf` file does not contain any methods or functions. Instead, it uses the Terraform configuration language to define outputs using the `output` block.

### `output "name"`
This output represents the name of the Azure Resource Group.

- `value`: Specifies the value of the output, in this case, the name of the Azure Resource Group.
- `description`: Provides a description of the output, indicating that it represents the Resource Group name.

Example:
```terraform
output "name" {
  value       = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  description = "Resource Group name"
}
```

### `output "location"`
This output represents the location (Azure region) of the Azure Resource Group.

- `value`: Specifies the value of the output, in this case, the location of the Azure Resource Group.
- `description`: Provides a description of the output, indicating that it represents the Resource Group Azure region.

Example:
```terraform
output "location" {
  value       = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
  description = "Resource Group Azure region"
}
```

## Useful details
- The `outputs.tf` file is used to define outputs in a Terraform configuration.
- Outputs are values that can be accessed by other parts of the infrastructure.
- Outputs are typically used to share important information about resources, such as their names, addresses, or connection details.
- Outputs can be referenced in other Terraform files or used to populate variables in external systems.
