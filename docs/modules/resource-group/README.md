## Overview
The `resource-group` folder contains the files `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf`. These files are used in a Terraform project to define and manage Azure resources, specifically creating an Azure resource group. The purpose of this folder is to provide the necessary code and configuration for creating and managing the resource group within the larger software project.

## Usage
To utilize the code in this folder, you will need to have Terraform (version 0.12 or later) and Azure CLI (version 2.0 or later) installed as dependencies. 

1. Start by configuring the necessary Terraform provider for Azure.
2. Edit the `main.tf` file to specify the desired configuration for the Azure resource group.
3. Edit the `variables.tf` file to define any necessary variables for customization.
4. Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform project.
5. Run `terraform plan` to preview the changes that will be applied to the Azure environment.
6. Run `terraform apply` to create the resource group in Azure.

## Useful details
- The `main.tf` file contains the Terraform configuration for creating an Azure resource group. It should be edited to specify the desired configuration.
- The `variables.tf` file allows users to define customizable variables for the Terraform project.
- The `outputs.tf` file is used to define the outputs of the Terraform module, providing information about the created resources or their attributes.
- Make sure to have the necessary dependencies (Terraform and Azure CLI) installed before using this code.
- Refer to the specific sections in each file for more detailed information on prerequisites, usage, and additional details.
