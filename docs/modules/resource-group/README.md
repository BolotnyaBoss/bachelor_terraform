## Overview
The `resource-group` folder contains the necessary files and content for managing Azure resource groups in a software project. It includes the `main.tf`, `outputs.tf`, and `variables.tf` files, each serving a specific purpose in the overall project.

## Usage
To utilize the `resource-group` module, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the prerequisites are met (detailed in the respective sections of each file).
2. Instantiate the module by including the `main.tf`, `outputs.tf`, and `variables.tf` files in your project.
3. Customize the variables in the `variables.tf` file to suit your project requirements.
4. Run Terraform commands to create and manage Azure resource groups based on the configuration defined in the `main.tf` file.
5. Utilize the outputs defined in the `outputs.tf` file for other parts of the project or external consumers.

## Useful details
Here are some additional details about each file in the `resource-group` folder:

### main.tf
#### Overview
The `main.tf` file is a Terraform configuration file used to define and manage Azure resource groups. It utilizes the `azurerm_resource_group` resource to create a resource group in the Azure cloud platform. The file plays a crucial role in provisioning and managing the infrastructure resources required for a software project in Azure.

### outputs.tf
#### Overview
The `outputs.tf` file is used to define the outputs of a Terraform configuration. It allows users to specify the values they want to expose as outputs, which can be useful for other parts of the project or for external consumers. The file contains output blocks that define the name, value, and description of each output.

### variables.tf
#### Overview
The `variables.tf` file is used to define variables that can be used throughout the project. These variables can be used to store information such as resource group names, locations, and other project-specific details. This file plays a crucial role in providing flexibility and customization to the project by allowing users to easily modify these variables without modifying the actual code.
