## Overview
The `resource-group` folder is an important component of the project as it houses the necessary files and subfolders related to the management and configuration of resource groups. Resource groups are logical containers that help organize and manage resources in a cloud environment. This folder provides the necessary infrastructure code to create and manage resource groups within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the `resource-group` module in your project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have the necessary credentials and access to the cloud provider's console or API.
2. Open the `variables.tf.md` file to review and customize the variables specific to your project's resource group requirements.
3. Edit the `main.tf.md` file to define the desired configuration for the resource group. This may include specifying the name, location, and any additional settings.
4. Review the `outputs.tf.md` file to understand the outputs that are exposed by the module.
5. Instantiate the `resource-group` module in your project's main code or infrastructure-as-code script.
6. Provide the necessary values for the variables defined in the `variables.tf.md` file.
7. Run the code or script to create the resource group as per the specified configuration.

## Useful details
- The `variables.tf.md` file contains the variables that can be customized to suit the project's resource group requirements. These variables include the resource group name, location, and any additional settings.
- The `main.tf.md` file defines the configuration for the resource group. It includes the necessary code to create and manage the resource group based on the specified settings.
- The `outputs.tf.md` file defines the outputs that are exposed by the `resource-group` module. These outputs can be used to retrieve information about the created resource group, such as its ID or name.
- It is important to review and understand the cloud provider's documentation regarding resource groups and their usage before utilizing this module in your project.
