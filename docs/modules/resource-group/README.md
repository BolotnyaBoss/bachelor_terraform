# docs/modules/resource-group/README.md

## Overview
The `resource-group` folder contains the necessary files and configurations for creating and managing an Azure resource group using Terraform. The resource group is a logical container for resources in Azure and plays a crucial role in organizing and managing infrastructure resources.

## Usage
To utilize the `resource-group` module in a project, follow these steps:
1. Ensure that the necessary dependencies and prerequisites are met.
2. Instantiate the module by including the `main.tf`, `outputs.tf`, and `variables.tf` files in your project.
3. Customize the variables defined in the `variables.tf` file according to your project requirements.
4. Run Terraform commands to create and manage the resource group using the defined configurations.

## Useful details
- The `main.tf` file defines the Terraform configurations for creating an Azure resource group. It serves as the main entry point for the Terraform project and specifies the resources that will be created or managed.
- The `outputs.tf` file is used to define the outputs of the Terraform configuration. It specifies the values that will be made available for other parts of the infrastructure to consume.
- The `variables.tf` file is used to declare and define variables that will be used in the project. These variables can provide dynamic values to other parts of the project, such as resource group names and locations. Ensure that the variables are customized according to your project requirements.
