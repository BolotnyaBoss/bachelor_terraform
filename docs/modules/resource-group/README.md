# /docs/modules/resource-group/README.md

## Overview
The `/docs/modules/resource-group` folder is dedicated to providing documentation for the resource group module in the project. This module is designed to manage the creation and configuration of resource groups within a software project. Resource groups play a crucial role in organizing and managing resources in cloud environments, providing a logical container for resources that share the same lifecycle, permissions, and policies.

## Usage
To utilize the resource group module in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Navigate to the `/docs/modules/resource-group` folder.
3. Review the documentation files provided:
   - `variables.tf.md`: This file lists the variables that can be configured when using the resource group module. It provides details on each variable, including their types, descriptions, and default values. Modify these variables as needed to customize the behavior of the resource group module.
   - `main.tf.md`: This file contains the main configuration code for the resource group module. It defines the resources and their settings that will be created when using this module. Review and understand the code to ensure it aligns with your project requirements. Make any necessary modifications to suit your specific needs.
   - `outputs.tf.md`: This file specifies the outputs that will be generated when using the resource group module. Outputs allow you to retrieve and use information from the created resources elsewhere in your project. Examine the defined outputs to understand what information you can extract and utilize.

## Useful details
- The resource group module is designed to work with cloud environments and infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools, such as Terraform. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies and tools installed before using this module.
- It is recommended to review the documentation files thoroughly before utilizing the resource group module in your project. Understanding the available variables, the main configuration code, and the defined outputs will help you effectively use and customize the module.
- Feel free to modify the module's code and variables according to your specific requirements. However, exercise caution and ensure that any modifications align with best practices and do not introduce any unintended consequences.
- If you encounter any issues or have questions regarding the resource group module, please refer to the project's issue tracker or reach out to the project's development team for assistance.
