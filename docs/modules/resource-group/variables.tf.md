## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use this file.

## Usage
To use the variables defined in this file, you need to instantiate them in your project's code. Here is an example of how to use the `resource_group_name` variable:

```terraform
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = var.resource_group_name
  location = var.location
}
```

In this example, the `azurerm_resource_group` resource is defined, and the `name` and `location` parameters are set using the `var.resource_group_name` and `var.location` variables respectively.

## Variables
The `variables.tf` file defines the following variables:

### resource_group_name
- Type: `string`
- Description: The name of the resource group

### location
- Type: `string`
- Description: The location of the resource group

These variables can be used throughout the project to configure resource groups and other related components.

## Useful details
- It is recommended to provide meaningful descriptions for each variable to improve the understandability of the code.
- The values of these variables can be set in various ways, such as through command-line arguments, configuration files, or environment variables.
