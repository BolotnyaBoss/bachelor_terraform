# variables.tf
## Overview
The `variables.tf` file is used to define variables that can be used throughout a software project. It allows for the customization and flexibility of certain values without hardcoding them into the code. These variables can be used in various parts of the project, such as in the main code, configuration files, or deployment scripts.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use the `variables.tf` file.

## Usage
To utilize the `variables.tf` file in a project, follow these steps:
1. Create a new file named `variables.tf` in the desired directory of your project.
2. Define the variables you need using the following syntax:
```
variable "<variable_name>" {
    type        = <variable_type>
    description = "<variable_description>"
}
```
3. Replace `<variable_name>` with the desired name for your variable.
4. Replace `<variable_type>` with the type of your variable (e.g., `string`, `number`, `bool`).
5. Replace `<variable_description>` with a brief description of your variable.

## Variables
The `variables.tf` file allows for the declaration of custom variables that can be used throughout the project. The variables defined in this file can be accessed and used in other parts of the project, such as in the main code, configuration files, or deployment scripts.

The following variables are defined in the `variables.tf` file:

### resource_group_name
- Type: `string`
- Description: The name of the resource group

### location
- Type: `string`
- Description: The location of the resource group

These variables can be referenced and used in other parts of the project using the syntax `var.<variable_name>`. For example:
```python
resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
```

## Useful details
- The `variables.tf` file is typically used to define variables that are used across multiple files or modules in a project.
- It is recommended to provide clear and descriptive names and descriptions for variables to improve code readability and maintainability.
- Variables defined in the `variables.tf` file can be overridden or provided with default values when running the project.
