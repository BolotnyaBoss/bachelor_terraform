# variables.tf

## Overview
The `variables.tf` file is used to define and declare variables that will be used in a software project. These variables can be used to provide dynamic values to other parts of the project, such as resource group names and locations.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use the `variables.tf` file.

## Usage
To use the `variables.tf` file in a project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file called `variables.tf` in your project directory.
2. Copy the code from the provided code example into the `variables.tf` file.
3. Modify the variables according to your project requirements.
4. Use the variables in other parts of your project by referencing them using the syntax `var.<variable_name>`.

## Variables
The `variables.tf` file defines the following variables:

1. `resource_group_name`: This variable represents the name of the resource group. It is of type `string` and can be used to provide a custom name for the resource group. Example usage:

```hcl
variable "resource_group_name" {
    type        = string
    description = "The name of resource group"
}
```

2. `location`: This variable represents the location of the resource group. It is of type `string` and can be used to specify the geographic location where the resource group will be created. Example usage:

```hcl
variable "location" {
    type        = string
    description = "The location of resource group"
}
```

## Useful details
- The `description` field for each variable provides a brief explanation of its purpose.
- The `type` field specifies the data type of the variable.
- The values of these variables can be accessed in other parts of the project by using the syntax `var.<variable_name>`. For example, to access the value of the `resource_group_name` variable, use `var.resource_group_name`.
- The values of these variables can be provided when running Terraform commands, either through command-line flags or by using a `.tfvars` file.
