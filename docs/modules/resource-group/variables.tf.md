# variables.tf
## Overview
The `variables.tf` file is used to define variables that can be used throughout the project. These variables can be used to store information such as resource group names, locations, and other project-specific details. This file plays a crucial role in providing flexibility and customization to the project by allowing users to easily modify these variables without modifying the actual code.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use the `variables.tf` file.

## Usage
To use the `variables.tf` file, you need to define the desired variables and their properties. In the provided code example, two variables, `resource_group_name` and `location`, are defined.

```terraform
variable "resource_group_name" {
    type        = string
    description = "The name of resource group"
}

variable "location" {
    type        = string
    description = "The location of resource group"
}
```

To utilize these variables in the project, you can reference them in other Terraform files using the `var` keyword followed by the variable name. For example:

```terraform
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = var.resource_group_name
  location = var.location
}
```

## Methods
There are no methods or functions in the `variables.tf` file. It is solely used for defining variables and their properties.

## Useful details
- The `type` property of a variable determines the data type of the variable. In the provided code example, both `resource_group_name` and `location` variables have a type of `string`, indicating that they can store string values.
- The `description` property provides a brief description or explanation of the variable, helping users understand its purpose or expected value.
- Variables defined in the `variables.tf` file can be accessed in other Terraform files within the same project by using the `var` keyword followed by the variable name. For example, `var.resource_group_name`.
