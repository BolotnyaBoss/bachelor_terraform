# main.tf
## Overview
The `main.tf` file is a Terraform configuration file that defines the resources for an Azure storage account, storage container, and storage blob. It is used to provision and manage these Azure resources within a software project.

The code creates an Azure storage account (`azurerm_storage_account` resource) with a specified name, resource group, location, account tier, and replication type. It then creates a storage container (`azurerm_storage_container` resource) within the storage account, with a specified name and access type. Finally, it creates a storage blob (`azurerm_storage_blob` resource) within the storage container, with a specified name, type, and source.

This file plays a crucial role in infrastructure provisioning and management, as it allows developers to define and configure the necessary Azure storage resources for their software applications.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use this file. However, the user should have Terraform installed and configured to work with Azure.

## Usage
To use this file in a project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Terraform configuration file (e.g., `main.tf`) in your project directory.
2. Copy and paste the code from the provided `main.tf` into your newly created file.
3. Update the variable values in the code to match your desired configuration. For example, you can change the `var.storage_account_name` to specify the desired name for the storage account.
4. Save the file and run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform project.
5. Run `terraform apply` to provision the Azure storage resources defined in the `main.tf` file.

## Methods
This file does not contain any methods or functions. Instead, it defines Terraform resources using the Azure provider. The resources created are:

1. `azurerm_storage_account`:
   - Parameters:
     - `name`: Specifies the name of the storage account.
     - `resource_group_name`: Specifies the name of the resource group where the storage account will be created.
     - `location`: Specifies the Azure region where the storage account will be created.
     - `account_tier`: Specifies the tier of the storage account (e.g., "Standard").
     - `account_replication_type`: Specifies the replication type for the storage account (e.g., "LRS").
   
2. `azurerm_storage_container`:
   - Parameters:
     - `name`: Specifies the name of the storage container.
     - `storage_account_name`: Specifies the name of the storage account where the container will be created.
     - `container_access_type`: Specifies the access type for the storage container (e.g., "blob").
   
3. `azurerm_storage_blob`:
   - Parameters:
     - `name`: Specifies the name of the storage blob.
     - `storage_account_name`: Specifies the name of the storage account where the blob will be created.
     - `storage_container_name`: Specifies the name of the storage container where the blob will be created.
     - `type`: Specifies the type of the storage blob (e.g., "Block").
     - `source`: Specifies the source of the storage blob (e.g., path to a file).

## Useful details
This code snippet is written in HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language), which is used by Terraform to define infrastructure resources. It utilizes the Azure provider for Terraform (`azurerm`) to create and manage Azure storage resources. The variables used in the code (e.g., `var.storage_account_name`) should be defined and assigned appropriate values in the Terraform project's variables file (`variables.tf`).
