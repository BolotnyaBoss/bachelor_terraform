## Overview
The `storage-account` folder contains the necessary files for provisioning an Azure Storage Account, Storage Container, and Storage Blob using Terraform. This folder plays a crucial role in a software project as it allows for the creation and management of storage resources in the Azure cloud platform.

## Usage
To utilize the `storage-account` module in your project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Terraform is installed on your system with version X.X.X.
2. Open the `main.tf` file and review the infrastructure resources defined within. Update any necessary configuration settings such as resource names, access controls, and other properties.
3. Execute the Terraform script to provision the storage resources by running the command `terraform apply`.
4. If needed, access the output variables defined in the `outputs.tf` file for further use within your project or by external consumers.

## Useful details
- The `main.tf` file defines the infrastructure resources to be provisioned on the Azure cloud platform, including the Storage Account, Storage Container, and Storage Blob. Review and update the configuration settings as needed.
- The `outputs.tf` file defines the output variables generated by the infrastructure deployment. These output variables can be accessed and utilized by other parts of the project or external consumers.
- The `variables.tf` file defines the variables used in the project, allowing users to input values for customization during the Terraform script execution.

Please ensure that you have the necessary prerequisites listed in each file before utilizing them in your project.
