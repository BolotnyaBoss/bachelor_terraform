## Overview
The `storage-account` module is a crucial component of the software project, as it provides the necessary resources and configuration for managing an Azure storage account, storage container, and storage blob. This module is responsible for provisioning and managing these resources within the project.

## Usage
To utilize the `storage-account` module in your project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the necessary prerequisites in place (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section).
2. Instantiate the module by including it in your Terraform configuration file.
3. Customize the module by providing the required input variables and values.
4. Run the Terraform commands to initialize, plan, and apply the configuration.
5. Access the output values defined in the `outputs.tf` file to retrieve important information about the deployed resources.

## Useful details
- The `main.tf` file defines the resources for an Azure storage account, storage container, and storage blob. It creates the storage account with specified configurations such as name, resource group, location, account tier, and replication type. It also creates a storage container within the account.
- The `outputs.tf` file is used to define and document the output variables that can be accessed by other parts of the Terraform project or external systems. It provides important information about the deployed resources, such as access keys, IP addresses, or resource IDs.
- The `variables.tf` file is used to define and declare variables that can be customized to suit the project's needs. These variables can store values that may change or require customization, such as resource names, file paths, or configuration settings. They provide flexibility and customization to the project.

For more details on each file and its purpose, refer to the individual file documentation within the `storage-account` module.
