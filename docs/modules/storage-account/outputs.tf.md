# outputs.tf
## Overview
The outputs.tf file is used in a Terraform project to define the output values that will be displayed after the infrastructure is provisioned. It allows users to retrieve and display important information about the deployed resources, such as access keys, IP addresses, or resource IDs.

The primary purpose of this file is to define and document the output variables that can be accessed by other parts of the Terraform project or by external systems. It plays a crucial role in providing visibility into the provisioned resources and facilitating further integration or automation.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites for the outputs.tf file itself. However, it assumes that the main Terraform configuration files (e.g., main.tf) and the required provider configurations (e.g., provider.tf) are already in place.

## Usage
To utilize the outputs.tf file in a Terraform project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file with the name outputs.tf in the project directory.
2. Define the desired output variables using the `output` block syntax.
3. Specify the value of each output variable using Terraform expressions or by referencing other resource attributes.
4. Optionally, provide a description for each output variable to document its purpose or usage.

Example:
```hcl
output "primary_key" {
  value       = azurerm_storage_account.sa.primary_access_key
  description = "Primary key of storage account"
}
```

In the above example, an output variable named `primary_key` is defined, which retrieves the `primary_access_key` attribute from the `azurerm_storage_account` resource. The description field provides additional information about the output variable.

## Methods
The outputs.tf file does not contain any methods or functions. It only defines the output variables using the `output` block syntax.

## Useful details
- The output variables defined in the outputs.tf file can be accessed from other parts of the Terraform project using interpolation syntax, such as `${output.primary_key}`.
- The output values can also be retrieved using the `terraform output` command after the infrastructure is provisioned.
- The outputs.tf file should be reviewed and updated whenever there are changes in the required output variables or their values.
