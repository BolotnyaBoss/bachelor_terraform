# outputs.tf
## Overview
The `outputs.tf` file is used to define and output certain values or variables from the infrastructure code. It is a part of a larger project that involves deployment and management of resources in a cloud environment, specifically in Azure.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use the `outputs.tf` file. However, it is assumed that the project is using Terraform as the infrastructure provisioning and management tool.

## Usage
To utilize the `outputs.tf` file in a project, follow these steps:
1. Create a new Terraform configuration or navigate to an existing one.
2. Create or open the `outputs.tf` file.
3. Add the desired output block(s) to define the values to be outputted. For example:

```terraform
output "primary_key" {
  value       = azurerm_storage_account.sa.primary_access_key
  description = "Primary key of storage account"
}
```

4. Save the `outputs.tf` file.

When the Terraform configuration is applied, the defined outputs will be displayed in the Terraform output.

## Methods
The `outputs.tf` file does not contain any methods or functions. It is used solely for defining output values from the infrastructure code.

## Useful details
- The `output` block in `outputs.tf` is used to define an output value.
- The `value` attribute specifies the value to be outputted. In the provided example, it is referencing the primary access key of a storage account.
- The `description` attribute provides a brief description or explanation of the output value. It can be helpful for documentation purposes.
- Multiple `output` blocks can be defined in the `outputs.tf` file to output multiple values.
- The output values defined in `outputs.tf` can be referenced in other parts of the Terraform configuration or used for external consumption.
- The output values are displayed when running `terraform apply` or `terraform output` commands.
