# variables.tf

## Overview
`variables.tf` is a Terraform configuration file that defines the variables used in a project. It allows users to input values for these variables when executing the Terraform script, providing flexibility and customization.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific prerequisites listed for `variables.tf`. However, it is assumed that the user has basic knowledge of Terraform and is familiar with the project requirements.

## Usage
To use `variables.tf` in a project:
1. Create a new `.tf` file (e.g., `main.tf`) and define the Terraform configuration.
2. Import the `variables.tf` file using the `terraform` block in the `.tf` file:
```terraform
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 0.13"
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = ">= 2.0"
    }
  }
}

```
3. Define the values for the variables in the imported `variables.tf` file:
```terraform
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = var.storage_account_name
  resource_group_name      = var.resource_group_name
  location                 = var.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}
```
4. When executing the Terraform script, provide input values for the variables through command-line flags or a `.tfvars` file.

## Methods
There are no methods or functions defined in `variables.tf`. It only contains variable declarations with their types and descriptions.

### Variables
- `resource_group_name`: The name of the resource group in which to create the storage account. (Type: string)
- `location`: The location where to create the storage account. (Type: string)
- `storage_account_name`: The name of the storage account. (Type: string)
- `storage_container_name`: The name of the storage container. (Type: string)
- `bacpac_file_name`: The file name of the bacpac for the database. (Type: string)
- `bacpac_path`: The path where the bacpac file for the database is located. (Type: string)

## Useful details
- The variables defined in `variables.tf` can be referenced and used in other Terraform configuration files within the project.
- The `type` parameter specifies the data type of the variable.
- The `description` parameter provides a brief explanation of the variable's purpose.
- It is important to provide meaningful and descriptive variable names and descriptions for clarity and maintainability of the project.
