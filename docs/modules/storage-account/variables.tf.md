# variables.tf
## Overview
The `variables.tf` file is used to define and declare variables that will be used in a software project. These variables can be used to configure different aspects of the project, such as resource names, locations, and file paths. This file plays a crucial role in allowing users to customize and configure the project according to their specific needs.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use the `variables.tf` file.

## Usage
To utilize the `variables.tf` file in a project, the user needs to declare and assign values to the variables defined in the file. These variables can then be referenced throughout the project to provide dynamic configuration.

Example usage:
```terraform
variable "resource_group_name" {
    type        = string
    description = "The name of resource group in which to create storage account"
}

variable "location" {
    type        = string
    description = "The location where create storage account"
}

variable "storage_account_name" {
    type        = string
    description = "The name of storage account"
}

variable "storage_container_name" {
    type        = string
    description = "The name of storage container"
}

variable "bacpac_file_name" {
    type        = string
    description = "The file name of bacpac for database"
}

variable "bacpac_path" {
    type        = string
    description = "The path where located bacpac file for database"
}
```

## Methods
There are no methods or functions defined in the `variables.tf` file. It only contains variable declarations.

## Useful details
- The `type` field in each variable declaration specifies the data type of the variable. In this case, all variables are of type `string`.
- The `description` field provides a brief description of the purpose of each variable.
- By assigning values to these variables, users can customize various aspects of the project, such as resource group name, storage account name, and file paths.
- These variables can be referenced in other files within the project to provide dynamic configuration.
