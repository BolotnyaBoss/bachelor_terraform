# variables.tf
## Overview
The `variables.tf` file is used to define and declare variables that will be used in a software project. These variables can be used to store values that may change or need to be customized, such as resource names, file paths, or configuration settings. This file plays a crucial role in providing flexibility and customization to the project.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use the `variables.tf` file. However, it is typically used in conjunction with other configuration files or code files in a software project.

## Usage
To use the `variables.tf` file, you can declare and set the values of the variables defined within the file. These variables can then be referenced in other parts of the project where their values are needed.

For example, you can set the value of the `resource_group_name` variable to "my-resource-group" by adding the following code to another file in the project:

```terraform
resource_group_name = "my-resource-group"
```

## Methods
The `variables.tf` file does not contain any methods or functions. Instead, it defines variables that can be used throughout the project.

The variables defined in the `variables.tf` file have the following properties:

- `type`: Specifies the data type of the variable. In this example, all variables are of type `string`.
- `description`: Provides a brief description of the variable and its purpose.

Here are the variables defined in the `variables.tf` file:

1. `resource_group_name`: Represents the name of the resource group in which to create a storage account.
2. `location`: Represents the location where the storage account should be created.
3. `storage_account_name`: Represents the name of the storage account.
4. `storage_container_name`: Represents the name of the storage container.
5. `bacpac_file_name`: Represents the file name of the bacpac for the database.
6. `bacpac_path`: Represents the path where the bacpac file for the database is located.

## Useful details
- The variables defined in the `variables.tf` file can be used across different files within the same project.
- The values of these variables can be changed or customized as per the project requirements.
- When using these variables, it is important to ensure that the correct data types are assigned to them.
- The descriptions provided for each variable can help in understanding their purpose and usage.
