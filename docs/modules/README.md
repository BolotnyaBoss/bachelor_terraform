# /docs/modules/README.md

## Overview
The `modules` folder is a crucial component of the project that contains subfolders and files used to define and configure various resources in an Azure infrastructure project. It plays a vital role in the overall software project by providing a centralized location for managing and provisioning infrastructure resources using Terraform.

## Usage
To utilize the `modules` folder in a project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Navigate to the `modules` folder.
3. Explore the subfolders and files to understand the purpose and functionality of each component.
4. Customize the configuration files based on the specific requirements of your project.
5. Instantiate the modules in your Terraform scripts to provision and manage infrastructure resources.

## Useful details
Here are some additional details about the contents of the `modules` folder:

### Subfolders:
- `resource-group`: This subfolder contains the necessary files to define and provision an Azure resource group using Terraform.
- `data-factory`: This subfolder contains the necessary files to define and provision an Azure data factory using Terraform.

### Files:
- `main.tf`: This file is used to define and configure various resources such as storage accounts and data factories in an Azure infrastructure project. It is written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) and is used by Terraform to provision and manage the infrastructure.
- `variables.tf`: This file is used to define variables that can be used throughout the project. These variables can be customized based on the specific requirements of the project. The primary purpose of this file is to provide a central location to define and manage the project's configuration.
- `outputs.tf`: This file is used to define and declare the outputs of the infrastructure resources provisioned using Terraform. It plays a crucial role in providing important information about the provisioned resources, such as their IP addresses or connection strings.

By leveraging the `modules` folder, developers can easily define, provision, and manage infrastructure resources in an Azure project using Terraform. The modular structure of the folder allows for scalability and reusability, enabling teams to efficiently develop and maintain complex infrastructure configurations.
