# variables.tf
## Overview
The `variables.tf` file is used to define variables that can be used in a Terraform project. These variables can be used to store and manage configuration values that are used throughout the project, such as resource names, locations, and other settings.

In this specific code example, the file defines several variables related to creating a storage account and configuring a data factory instance. These variables include the resource group name, location, data factory name, storage account name, and linked service name.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use the `variables.tf` file. However, it is typically used within a Terraform project and requires Terraform to be installed.

## Usage
To use the `variables.tf` file in a Terraform project, you can define values for these variables in a separate file, such as `terraform.tfvars` or by passing them as command line arguments when running Terraform commands. For example:

```
terraform apply -var 'resource_group_name=my-resource-group' -var 'location=westus' -var 'data_factory_name=my-data-factory' -var 'storage_account_name=my-storage-account' -var 'linked_service_name=my-linked-service'
```

## Methods
The `variables.tf` file does not contain any methods or functions. Instead, it defines variables that can be used within Terraform configuration files.

Here are the variables defined in the code:

### `resource_group_name`
- Type: string
- Description: The name of the resource group in which to create the storage account.

### `location`
- Type: string
- Description: The location where the storage account will be created.

### `data_factory_name`
- Type: string
- Description: The name of the data factory instance.

### `storage_account_name`
- Type: string
- Description: The name of the storage account.

### `linked_service_name`
- Type: string
- Description: The name of the linked service in the data factory instance.

## Useful details
- The variables defined in `variables.tf` can be referenced in other Terraform configuration files using the `var` syntax. For example, `var.resource_group_name`.
- It is good practice to define variables in a separate file like `variables.tf` to keep the configuration clean and easily manageable.
- The values of these variables can be overridden when running Terraform commands by using the `-var` flag.
- The `type` attribute of each variable determines the expected data type for the variable value. In this case, all variables are of type `string`.
