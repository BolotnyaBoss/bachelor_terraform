# variables.tf
## Overview
The `variables.tf` file contains a set of variables that can be used in a software project. These variables are used to define and configure various aspects of the project, such as the resource group name, location, data factory name, storage account name, and linked service name. 

This file plays a crucial role in the project as it allows users to easily customize and configure different parameters without modifying the actual code. By using variables, the project becomes more flexible and can adapt to different environments or requirements.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use this file.

## Usage
To use the variables defined in this file, you need to declare and assign values to them in your project's configuration. Here's an example of how to use these variables in a Terraform configuration file:

```terraform
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = var.storage_account_name
  resource_group_name      = var.resource_group_name
  location                 = var.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}
```

In this example, the variables `storage_account_name`, `resource_group_name`, and `location` are used to configure an Azure Storage Account resource.

## Methods
This file does not contain any methods or functions. It only defines variables that can be used in other parts of the project.

## Useful details
- The `type` attribute specifies the data type of the variable. In this case, all variables are of type `string`.
- The `description` attribute provides a brief description of what each variable represents or is used for.
