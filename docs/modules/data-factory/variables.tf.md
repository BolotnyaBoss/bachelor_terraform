# variables.tf
## Overview
The `variables.tf` file is used to define and declare variables in a software project. It is typically used in infrastructure-as-code projects or configuration management projects, where variables are used to customize and parameterize the deployment of resources or configurations.

In this specific example, the `variables.tf` file is used to define variables related to creating a storage account and linked service in a data factory instance. These variables include the resource group name, location, data factory name, storage account name, and linked service name.

## Prerequisites
No specific dependencies or prerequisites are required to use the `variables.tf` file.

## Usage
To use the `variables.tf` file in a project, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new file named `variables.tf` in the project directory.
2. Copy the code from the provided code example into the `variables.tf` file.
3. Customize the variable definitions according to your project's requirements.

For example, you can modify the `description` attribute of each variable to provide more specific information about the purpose or usage of the variable.

```terraform
variable "resource_group_name" {
    type        = string
    description = "The name of the resource group in which to create the storage account"
}

variable "location" {
    type        = string
    description = "The location where the storage account will be created"
}

variable "data_factory_name" {
    type        = string
    description = "The name of the data factory instance"
}

variable "storage_account_name" {
    type        = string
    description = "The name of the storage account"
}

variable "linked_service_name" {
    type        = string
    description = "The name of the linked service in the ADF instance"
}
```

## Methods
The `variables.tf` file does not contain any methods or functions. It only defines variables and their properties such as type and description.

## Useful details
- The variables defined in the `variables.tf` file can be later referenced in other Terraform configuration files to provide dynamic values during deployment.
- The `type` attribute of each variable specifies the data type of the variable. In this case, all variables are of type `string`.
- The `description` attribute provides a brief description of the variable's purpose or usage, which can be helpful for understanding the code or for documentation purposes.
