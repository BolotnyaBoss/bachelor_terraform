These variables can be used to configure and customize various aspects of the project, such as resource names, locations, and settings. This file plays a crucial role in providing flexibility and reusability to the project by allowing users to easily modify these variables as per their requirements.

## Usage
To use the `variables.tf` file in a project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file named `variables.tf` in the desired project directory.
2. Copy and paste the code from this file into the `variables.tf` file.
3. Modify the variable values as per your project requirements.
4. Save the file and use the variables in other files or scripts as needed.

## Methods
The `variables.tf` file contains variable declarations using the Terraform syntax. Each variable is defined with a name, type, and description. Here are the variables defined in this file:

1. `resource_group_name`: This variable represents the name of the resource group in which to create a storage account. It has a type of `string`. Example usage:

   ```terraform
   resource_group_name = "my-resource-group"
   ```

2. `location`: This variable represents the location where the storage account will be created. It has a type of `string`. Example usage:

   ```terraform
   location = "eastus"
   ```

3. `data_factory_name`: This variable represents the name of the data factory instance. It has a type of `string`. Example usage:

   ```terraform
   data_factory_name = "my-data-factory"
   ```

4. `storage_account_name`: This variable represents the name of the storage account. It has a type of `string`. Example usage:

   ```terraform
   storage_account_name = "my-storage-account"
   ```

5. `linked_service_name`: This variable represents the name of the linked service in the Azure Data Factory instance. It has a type of `string`. Example usage:

   ```terraform
   linked_service_name = "my-linked-service"
   ```

## Useful details
- The variables defined in this file can be referenced and used in other Terraform configuration files to provide dynamic values.
- The `description` field for each variable provides a brief explanation of its purpose and usage.
- The variable values can be set in multiple ways, such as through command-line flags, environment variables, or variable definition files.
- The `type` field specifies the data type of the variable, which helps in validation and type checking during the Terraform execution.
