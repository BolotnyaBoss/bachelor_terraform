# variables.tf
## Overview
This file is used to define variables that will be used in a project. It is typically used in infrastructure-as-code projects, such as Terraform, to define the configuration for deploying and managing resources in cloud environments.

## Prerequisites
No specific dependencies or prerequisites are required to use this file.
## Usage
To use this file in a project, you need to define and assign values to the variables defined in this file. The values can be provided directly in the file or passed through command-line arguments or environment variables. Here's an example of how to use the variables in a Terraform project:

```terraform
# main.tf

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = var.storage_account_name
  resource_group_name      = var.resource_group_name
  location                 = var.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}

resource "azurerm_data_factory" "example" {
  name                = var.data_factory_name
  resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
  location            = var.location
}

resource "azurerm_data_factory_linked_service" "example" {
  name                = var.linked_service_name
  data_factory_name   = azurerm_data_factory.example.name
  resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
}
```
In the above example, the variables defined in the `variables.tf` file are used to configure the deployment of various Azure resources, such as storage account, data factory, and linked service.

## Variables
- `resource_group_name`: The name of the resource group in which to create the storage account.
- `location`: The location where the storage account will be created.
- `data_factory_name`: The name of the data factory instance.
- `storage_account_name`: The name of the storage account.
- `linked_service_name`: The name of the linked service in the Azure Data Factory instance.

## Useful details
- The variables defined in this file can be referenced using the `var` prefix in other Terraform files.
- The `type` attribute specifies the data type of the variable. In this case, all variables are of type `string`.
- The `description` attribute provides a brief description of each variable's purpose and usage.
