## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use this file.

## Usage
To use the `variables.tf` file in a project, you need to define the required variables and their values. These variables can be customized based on the specific requirements of your project. Here is an example of how to use the variables in a Terraform configuration file:

```terraform
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = var.storage_account_name
  resource_group_name      = var.resource_group_name
  location                 = var.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}
```

In this example, the variables `storage_account_name`, `resource_group_name`, and `location` are used to configure an Azure Storage Account resource.

## Methods
The `variables.tf` file does not contain any methods or functions. It simply defines variables that can be used in other parts of the project.

## Useful details
- Each variable in the `variables.tf` file has a specified type, such as `string`, indicating the data type the variable should be.
- The `description` field provides a brief explanation of the purpose or usage of each variable.
- The variables can be referenced and used in other configuration files or modules within the project.
