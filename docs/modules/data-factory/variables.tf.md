# variables.tf
## Overview
The `variables.tf` file is used to define and declare variables that will be used in a software project. It allows for customizing and configuring different aspects of the project by providing values for these variables. This file plays a role in facilitating flexibility and modularity in the project, as it allows for easy modification of key parameters without modifying the actual code.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use the `variables.tf` file.

## Usage
To use the `variables.tf` file in a project, follow these steps:
1. Create a new file in the project directory named `variables.tf`.
2. Define the variables and their properties (type, description) using the following syntax:
```terraform
variable "variable_name" {
    type        = variable_type
    description = "Variable description"
}
```
3. Replace `variable_name` with the desired name for the variable.
4. Replace `variable_type` with the desired data type for the variable, such as `string`, `number`, etc.
5. Replace `Variable description` with a brief description of the variable's purpose or usage.

## Methods
The `variables.tf` file does not contain any methods or functions. It is simply used for declaring variables and their properties.

## Useful details
- Variables defined in the `variables.tf` file can be accessed and used in other files within the same Terraform project by referencing them using the `var.variable_name` syntax.
- The values assigned to these variables can be provided either directly in the `variables.tf` file or through command-line arguments when running Terraform commands.
- The `description` property is optional but recommended as it provides a clear explanation of the variable's purpose or expected value.
- The `type` property is required and specifies the data type of the variable.
- Example usage of a variable defined in `variables.tf`:
```terraform
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example_bucket" {
    bucket = var.storage_account_name
    region = var.location
}
```
