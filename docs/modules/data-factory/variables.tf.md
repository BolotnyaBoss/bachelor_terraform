# variables.tf
## Overview
The `variables.tf` file is used to define variables that will be used in a software project. These variables can be used to customize the behavior of the project or to pass in values from external sources. This file plays a crucial role in configuring the project and allows for flexibility and customization.

## Prerequisites
There are no dependencies or prerequisites required to use this file.

## Usage
To use the variables defined in `variables.tf`, you need to declare them in your code and assign values to them. Here's an example of how you can use these variables in a Terraform project:

```terraform
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = var.storage_account_name
  resource_group_name      = var.resource_group_name
  location                 = var.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}
```

In the above example, the variables `storage_account_name`, `resource_group_name`, and `location` are accessed using the `var` keyword and their corresponding values are used to create an Azure Storage Account.

## Methods
There are no methods or functions in this file. It only defines variables.

## Useful details
- The `type` attribute specifies the data type of the variable. In this case, all variables are defined as `string` type.
- The `description` attribute provides a brief description of the variable and its purpose. It helps in understanding the purpose and usage of the variable.
- You can assign default values to variables by using the `default` attribute. If a variable is not assigned a value when used, the default value will be used instead. However, in the given code, default values are not provided.
