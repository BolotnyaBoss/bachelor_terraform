# variables.tf
## Overview
The `variables.tf` file is used to define and declare variables that will be used in a software project. It is a part of the infrastructure as code (IaC) approach and is commonly used in tools like Terraform to define variables that can be passed to infrastructure resources.

In this specific code, the `variables.tf` file defines several variables related to creating a storage account and linked service in a resource group. These variables include the name of the resource group, the location, the data factory name, the storage account name, and the linked service name.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites for using the `variables.tf` file. However, it is typically used in conjunction with infrastructure deployment tools like Terraform or Azure Resource Manager.

## Usage
To use the variables defined in the `variables.tf` file, you need to instantiate them and provide appropriate values. These variables can be referenced in other files or modules within the project.

For example, to use the `resource_group_name` variable, you would instantiate it with a value like this:

```terraform
variable "resource_group_name" {
    type        = string
    description = "The name of resource group in which to create storage account"
}
```

## Methods
There are no methods or functions defined in the `variables.tf` file. It solely focuses on defining variables and their descriptions.

## Useful details
- The `type` attribute in each variable declaration specifies the data type of the variable, in this case, `string`.
- The `description` attribute provides a brief description of what each variable is used for.
- These variables can be referenced and used in other parts of the project to provide dynamic values for resource creation or configuration.
