# variables.tf
## Overview
The `variables.tf` file is used to define the variables that will be used throughout the project. These variables can be customized based on the specific requirements of the project. The primary purpose of this file is to provide a central location to define and manage the variables used in the project.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use the `variables.tf` file.

## Usage
To use the `variables.tf` file, you need to define the variables and their properties. These variables can be referenced in other files within the project.

For example, to define the `resource_group_name` variable, you can use the following code:

```terraform
variable "resource_group_name" {
    type        = string
    description = "The name of resource group in which to create storage account"
}
```

The `type` property defines the data type of the variable, and the `description` property provides a brief explanation of the variable's purpose.

Once the variables are defined, they can be referenced in other Terraform files using the `var` keyword. For example:

```terraform
resource "azure_storage_account" "example" {
    name                = var.storage_account_name
    resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
    location            = var.location
}
```

## Methods
The `variables.tf` file does not contain any methods or functions. It is solely used for defining variables.

## Useful details
- The variables defined in the `variables.tf` file can be accessed and used in other Terraform files by referencing them with the `var` keyword.
- The values of the variables can be customized based on the requirements of the project.
- It is good practice to provide meaningful descriptions for each variable to ensure clarity and maintainability of the project.
