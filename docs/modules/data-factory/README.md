## Overview
The `data-factory` folder contains the `main.tf` and `variables.tf` files, which are used in an Azure infrastructure project to define and configure various resources. The `main.tf` file is written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) and is used by the Terraform tool to deploy and manage the Azure resources. The `variables.tf` file is used to define and declare variables that will be used in the project.

## Usage
To use the `data-factory` folder in a project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Terraform (version X) is installed.
2. Copy the `main.tf` and `variables.tf` files into your project directory.
3. Open the `variables.tf` file and modify the variable definitions as needed for your project.
4. Open the `main.tf` file and configure the Azure resources according to your project requirements.
5. Run the Terraform commands to initialize the project and deploy the Azure resources.
