## Overview
The `data-factory` folder contains the necessary files for configuring and provisioning resources in Microsoft Azure for data processing and storage. It includes the `main.tf` file, which sets up an Azure Storage Account, an Azure Data Factory, and a linked service to Azure Blob Storage. Additionally, it includes the `variables.tf` file, which defines variables that can be used to customize the project behavior and pass in values from external sources. This folder plays a crucial role in the larger project as it establishes the infrastructure components required for data handling in Azure.

## Usage
To utilize the `data-factory` folder in a project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the necessary prerequisites in place.
2. Copy the `main.tf` and `variables.tf` files from the `data-factory` folder into your project directory.
3. Open the `main.tf` file and configure the desired settings for your Azure Storage Account, Azure Data Factory, and linked service to Azure Blob Storage.
4. Open the `variables.tf` file and update the variables according to your project requirements.
5. Save the changes and run the necessary Terraform commands to provision the resources defined in the `main.tf` file.

## Useful details
- The `main.tf` file is a Terraform configuration file that defines and provisions resources in Microsoft Azure for data processing and storage.
- The `variables.tf` file is used to define variables that can be customized to tailor the project behavior and pass in values from external sources.
- Make sure to have the necessary prerequisites in place before using the `data-factory` folder.
- Refer to the documentation for the specific Terraform commands required to provision the resources defined in the `main.tf` file.
