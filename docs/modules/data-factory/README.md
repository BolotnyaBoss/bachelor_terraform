## Overview
The `data-factory` folder contains the `main.tf` and `variables.tf` files, which are used in an Azure infrastructure project. These files play a crucial role in defining the resources and their configurations and are written in the Terraform language.

## Usage
To utilize the `main.tf` and `variables.tf` files in your project, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
- Terraform installed (version X.X.X)
- A

To use the `main.tf` file, you need to define the desired state of your infrastructure by specifying the resources and their configurations. This file acts as a blueprint for creating and managing your Azure infrastructure.

The `variables.tf` file allows you to define variables that can be used throughout your Terraform project. These variables store configuration values such as resource names, locations, and other settings. In the provided code example, the `variables.tf` file defines several variables related to creating a storage account and configuring a data factory instance.
