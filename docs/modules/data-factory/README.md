## Overview
The `data-factory` folder contains two important files: `main.tf` and `variables.tf`. These files are used to define and provision Azure resources for data integration and orchestration tasks. The `main.tf` file focuses on creating an Azure Data Factory and linking it to an Azure Blob Storage account, while the `variables.tf` file is used to define variables that will be used in the project.

## Usage
To use the `main.tf` file, you need to have Terraform installed on your machine. Once you have Terraform set up, you can simply run the `terraform apply` command in the directory where the `main.tf` file is located. This will create an Azure Data Factory and link it to an Azure Blob Storage account.

To use the `variables.tf` file, you can define the necessary variables for your project within the file itself. These variables can then be referenced and used in other files within your project.

## Useful details
- The `main.tf` file is crucial for automating the creation of data pipelines, data movement, and data transformation activities in a software project.
- The `variables.tf` file helps in defining the configuration for deploying and managing resources in cloud environments.
- No specific dependencies or prerequisites are required to use the `variables.tf` file.
