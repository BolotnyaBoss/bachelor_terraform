# docs/modules/data-factory/README.md

## Overview
The `data-factory` folder contains the necessary files for provisioning Azure resources for a data factory. This folder plays a crucial role in the software project as it sets up the infrastructure for data processing and storage in Azure.

## Usage
To utilize the `data-factory` module in your project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the necessary prerequisites in place (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)).
2. Instantiate the `main.tf` file by running the Terraform configuration, which will create a storage account, data factory, and a linked service for Azure Blob Storage. This can be done by executing the appropriate Terraform commands.
3. Configure the variables defined in the `variables.tf` file based on your requirements.
4. Customize the deployment by modifying the variables as needed.
5. Run the Terraform commands to provision the Azure resources for the data factory.

## Useful details
- The `main.tf` file is responsible for defining and provisioning the Azure resources. It sets up the necessary infrastructure for data processing and storage in Azure.
- The `variables.tf` file is used for defining variables that can be used to configure various aspects of the infrastructure. It allows for customization and flexibility in the deployment process.
- Make sure to review the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section before using the `data-factory` module.
- Refer to the [Methods](#methods) section in the `main.tf` file for specific details on how the resources are provisioned.
- The `Useful details` section in both files provides additional information that may be helpful during the usage and configuration of the module.
