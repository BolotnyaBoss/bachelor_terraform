1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Navigate to the `data-factory` folder.
3. Review and modify the `variables.tf` file to set the desired configuration options for your project.
4. Use the `main.tf` file to define and manage Azure resources specific to your project's requirements.

## Useful details
- The `variables.tf` file is used to define and declare variables that can be customized to configure various aspects of the project, such as resource names, locations, and settings.
- The `main.tf` file is a Terraform configuration file responsible for defining and managing Azure resources. It is an integral part of the infrastructure-as-code project and should be customized to suit your project's infrastructure requirements.
