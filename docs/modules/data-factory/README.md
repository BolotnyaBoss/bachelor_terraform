## Overview
The `data-factory` module is designed to handle the creation and management of data factories in a software project. A data factory is a cloud-based data integration service that orchestrates and automates the movement and transformation of data sources. This module plays a crucial role in the project by providing a centralized and scalable solution for data integration.

## Usage
To utilize the `data-factory` module in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Navigate to the `data-factory` module folder.
3. Open the `variables.tf.md` file to view and customize the variables used in the module.
4. Open the `main.tf.md` file to define the infrastructure resources and configurations for the data factory.
5. Instantiate the module in your project's main configuration file by referencing the `data-factory` module and providing the necessary variable values.

## Useful details
- The `variables.tf.md` file contains a list of variables that can be customized to fit the project's requirements. These variables include details such as the data factory name, location, and resource group.
- The `main.tf.md` file defines the infrastructure resources and configurations for the data factory. It includes the creation of data pipelines, linked services, datasets, and other components necessary for data integration.
- Make sure to review the documentation provided within each file for more specific instructions and details on how to customize and utilize the `data-factory` module.
- It is recommended to integrate this module with other modules and components of the project to achieve a comprehensive data integration solution.
