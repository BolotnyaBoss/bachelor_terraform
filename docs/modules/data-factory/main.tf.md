# main.tf
## Overview
The `main.tf` file is a Terraform configuration file that is used to define and manage Azure resources. It is a part of a larger infrastructure-as-code project where Terraform is used to provision and manage infrastructure resources on Azure. This specific file is responsible for creating an Azure Data Factory and a linked service to Azure Blob Storage.

## Prerequisites
To use this `main.tf` file, the following prerequisites are required:
- Terraform installed on the machine
- Azure CLI installed on the machine
- Azure subscription and access credentials

## Usage
To use this `main.tf` file, follow these steps:

1. Set up the Azure CLI and login to your Azure account.
2. Install Terraform on your machine.
3. Create a new directory for your Terraform project.
4. Create a new file named `main.tf` in the project directory.
5. Copy the code from this `main.tf` file into the newly created `main.tf` file.
6. Customize the variable values in the code according to your Azure environment and requirements.
7. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
8. Run the following command to initialize the Terraform project:
   ```
   terraform init
   ```
9. Run the following command to validate the Terraform configuration:
   ```
   terraform validate
   ```
10. Run the following command to create the Azure resources:
    ```
    terraform apply
    ```
11. Confirm the resource creation by typing `yes` when prompted.
12. Wait for Terraform to provision the resources on Azure.
13. Once the resources are provisioned, you can use the Azure Data Factory and the linked service to Azure Blob Storage in your project.

## Methods
This `main.tf` file defines the following resources and data sources:

1. **data "azurerm_storage_account" "example"**: This data source retrieves information about an existing Azure Storage Account. It takes the following parameters:
   - `name`: The name of the storage account.
   - `resource_group_name`: The name of the resource group that contains the storage account.
   
   Example:
   ```terraform
   data "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
     name                = var.storage_account_name
     resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
   }
   ```

2. **resource "azurerm_data_factory" "adf"**: This resource creates an Azure Data Factory. It takes the following parameters:
   - `name`: The name of the data factory.
   - `location`: The Azure region where the data factory should be created.
   - `resource_group_name`: The name of the resource group where the data factory should be created.
   
   Example:
   ```terraform
   resource "azurerm_data_factory" "adf" {
     name                = var.data_factory_name
     location            = var.location
     resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
   }
   ```

3. **resource "azurerm_data_factory_linked_service_azure_blob_storage" "adf-ls"**: This resource creates a linked service to Azure Blob Storage in the Azure Data Factory. It takes the following parameters:
   - `name`: The name of the linked service.
   - `data_factory_id`: The ID of the Azure Data Factory.
   - `connection_string`: The connection string to the Azure Blob Storage.
   
   Example:
   ```terraform
   resource "azurerm_data_factory_linked_service_azure_blob_storage" "adf-ls" {
     name              = var.linked_service_name
     data_factory_id   = azurerm_data_factory.adf.id
     connection_string = data.azurerm_storage_account.example.primary_connection_string
   }
   ```

## Useful details
- The `main.tf` file is a part of a larger Terraform project that includes other configuration files and modules.
- The Azure resources created by this `main.tf` file can be managed and updated using Terraform commands such as `terraform apply`, `terraform destroy`, etc.
- The values for the variables used in the code should be provided either directly in the `main.tf` file or through variable files or environment variables.
