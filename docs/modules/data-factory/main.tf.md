# main.tf
## Overview
The `main.tf` file is used in an Azure infrastructure project to define and provision resources such as storage accounts and data factories. It is written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) and is used with Terraform, an infrastructure as code tool. This file defines the configuration for creating a storage account, data factory, and a linked service for Azure Blob Storage.

## Prerequisites
To use the `main.tf` file, the following prerequisites are required:

- Terraform installed on the machine.
- Azure subscription and appropriate permissions to create resources.

## Usage
To utilize the `main.tf` file in a project:

1. Install Terraform on your machine.
2. Set up your Azure credentials by creating a `main.tfvars` file with the necessary variables.
3. Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform project.
4. Run `terraform plan` to see the planned changes.
5. Run `terraform apply` to create the resources defined in the `main.tf` file.

## Methods
The `main.tf` file defines the following resources and their properties:

1. `data "azurerm_storage_account" "example"`: This data source retrieves information about an existing Azure Storage Account. It requires the `storage_account_name` and `resource_group_name` variables to be provided.

2. `resource "azurerm_data_factory" "adf"`: This resource block creates an Azure Data Factory. It requires the `data_factory_name`, `location`, and `resource_group_name` variables to be provided.

3. `resource "azurerm_data_factory_linked_service_azure_blob_storage" "adf-ls"`: This resource block creates a linked service for Azure Blob Storage in the Azure Data Factory. It requires the `linked_service_name` variable and references the previously created Azure Data Factory resource. It also uses the `primary_connection_string` from the `data.azurerm_storage_account.example` data source.

## Useful details
- The `main.tf` file can be part of a larger Terraform project that includes other configuration files and resources.
- Ensure that the necessary variables are provided either directly in the `main.tf` file or through a separate variables file.
- The `azurerm_storage_account` data source retrieves information about an existing Azure Storage Account, such as its primary connection string, which is then used in the creation of the linked service for Azure Blob Storage.
- The created Azure Data Factory and linked service can be further configured and used to orchestrate data pipelines and perform data integration tasks in Azure.
