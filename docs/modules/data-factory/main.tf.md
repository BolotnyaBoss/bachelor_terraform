# main.tf
## Overview
The `main.tf` file is a Terraform configuration file that defines the infrastructure resources required for an Azure Data Factory in an Azure environment. It utilizes the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) provider for Terraform to manage the resources.

The file includes three main sections:
1. The `data` block retrieves information about an existing Azure Storage Account using the "azurerm_storage_account" data source.
2. The `resource` block creates an Azure Data Factory using the "azurerm_data_factory" resource.
3. The `resource` block creates a linked service to an Azure Blob Storage Account using the "azurerm_data_factory_linked_service_azure_blob_storage" resource.

This configuration file plays a crucial role in provisioning and managing the Azure Data Factory and its associated linked services in an infrastructure-as-code (IaC) approach.

## Prerequisites
Before using this `main.tf` file, the following prerequisites are required:
- Terraform installed on the local machine
- Azure subscription and credentials
- Azure Resource Manager (ARM) provider for Terraform

## Usage
To use this `main.tf` file, follow these steps:
1. Ensure that the prerequisites are met.
2. Set the necessary variables in a separate Terraform variables file (e.g., `variables.tf`).
3. Initialize Terraform in the project directory:
```bash
terraform init
```
4. Review the execution plan to see the proposed changes:
```bash
terraform plan
```
5. Apply the configuration to create the Azure Data Factory and linked services:
```bash
terraform apply
```

## Methods
This `main.tf` file does not contain any methods or functions. It defines the infrastructure resources using Terraform's declarative syntax.

## Useful details
- The `data.azurerm_storage_account.example.primary_connection_string` value is used to establish the connection between the Azure Data Factory and the Azure Blob Storage Account.
- The configuration can be extended to include additional resources and services required for an Azure Data Factory, such as datasets, pipelines, and activities.
- The variable values (`var.storage_account_name`, `var.resource_group_name`, etc.) are expected to be provided through a separate variables file or through command-line variables when running Terraform commands.
