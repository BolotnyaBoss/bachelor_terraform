# outputs.tf
## Overview
The `outputs.tf` file is used to define the outputs or results of a Terraform configuration. It specifies the data that should be exposed to the user after the infrastructure is provisioned. This file plays a crucial role in a software project as it allows users to retrieve important information about the deployed infrastructure, such as resource IDs, IP addresses, or other relevant details.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use the `outputs.tf` file. However, it assumes that the Terraform configuration file (`main.tf`) and the necessary provider configurations are already set up.

## Usage
To use the `outputs.tf` file, follow these steps:
1. Open the existing Terraform configuration file (`main.tf`) or create a new one if it doesn't exist.
2. Import the `outputs.tf` file into the main Terraform configuration using the `module` block or by referencing the file directly.
3. Define the desired outputs using the `output` block, specifying the value and description as needed.
4. Save the changes and run the Terraform commands to apply the configuration.

Example usage of `outputs.tf`:

```terraform
output "id" {
  value       = azurerm_mssql_server.server.id
  description = "ID of SQL Server"
}
```

## Methods
The `outputs.tf` file does not contain any methods or functions. Instead, it uses the Terraform-specific syntax to define outputs. Each output is defined using the `output` block followed by a unique name, value, and optional description.

The syntax for defining an output is as follows:
```terraform
output "<name>" {
  value       = <value>
  description = "<description>"
}
```

In the provided code example:
- The output name is "id".
- The value is the `id` attribute of the `azurerm_mssql_server.server` resource.
- The description is "ID of SQL Server".

## Useful details
- The outputs defined in the `outputs.tf` file can be retrieved using the `terraform output` command after the Terraform configuration is applied. For example, to retrieve the value of the "id" output, run `terraform output id`.
- Outputs can be used for various purposes, such as configuring other resources, providing information to external systems, or displaying important details to the user interface.
