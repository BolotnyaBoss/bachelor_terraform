# outputs.tf
## Overview
The `outputs.tf` file is used to define and configure the outputs of a Terraform module. It allows users to specify the values that should be exposed as outputs after the infrastructure is provisioned. These outputs can be used by other Terraform modules or scripts to interact with the provisioned resources.

In this specific example, the code defines an output named "id" which represents the ID of an Azure SQL Server. The value of this output is obtained from the `azurerm_mssql_server.server.id` attribute, which is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the Terraform configuration.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use this file. However, it assumes that the `azurerm_mssql_server.server.id` attribute is defined elsewhere in the Terraform configuration.

## Usage
To use this `outputs.tf` file in a Terraform project, you need to:
1. Create a new `.tf` file or open an existing one.
2. Add or update the `outputs.tf` file in the project directory.
3. Define the desired outputs within the file using the `output` block syntax.
4. Run `terraform apply` to provision the infrastructure.
5. Access the output values using the `terraform output` command.

For example, to access the "id" output value, you can use the following command:
```
terraform output id
```

## Methods
The `outputs.tf` file does not contain any methods. It only defines the outputs using the `output` block syntax. In this example, there is one output defined:
- `id`: Represents the ID of an Azure SQL Server. It is obtained from the `azurerm_mssql_server.server.id` attribute.

## Useful details
- The outputs defined in `outputs.tf` can be referenced in other Terraform modules or scripts by using the `terraform_remote_state` data source or by passing them as input variables.
- The `description` field in the `output` block can be used to provide additional information or context about the output value.
- It is important to ensure that the outputs defined in `outputs.tf` are actually being used and consumed by other parts of the Terraform configuration or project. Otherwise, they may be considered unnecessary and can be removed to improve readability and maintainability.
