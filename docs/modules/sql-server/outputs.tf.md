# outputs.tf
## Overview
The `outputs.tf` file is used to define the output values of a Terraform module. It allows users to specify the values that should be exposed after the infrastructure is provisioned. These outputs can be used by other modules or external systems.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific prerequisites for using the `outputs.tf` file. However, it is assumed that you have a basic understanding of Terraform and have the necessary dependencies installed.

## Usage
To use the `outputs.tf` file, you need to define the desired outputs using the `output` block. Each output block consists of a unique identifier and a value that should be exposed. Additionally, a description can be provided to give more context to the output. Here's an example:

```terraform
output "id" {
  value       = azurerm_mssql_server.server.id
  description = "ID of SQL Server"
}
```

In this example, the output value is the ID of a SQL Server resource created using the `azurerm_mssql_server.server` resource. The value of this output can be accessed by other modules or external systems.

## Methods
There are no specific methods or functions in the `outputs.tf` file. It is simply used to define the outputs of a Terraform module.

## Useful details
- The outputs defined in the `outputs.tf` file can be referenced using the `terraform output` command. For example, to get the value of the `id` output defined above, you can run `terraform output id`.
- The outputs can also be accessed programmatically using the Terraform API or by parsing the Terraform state file.
- The values of the outputs are not known until the infrastructure is provisioned. Therefore, it is recommended to run `terraform apply` before accessing the outputs.
