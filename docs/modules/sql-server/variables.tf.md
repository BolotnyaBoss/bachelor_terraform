# variables.tf
## Overview
The `variables.tf` file is used to define and configure variables for a specific project. These variables can be used to store and manage data that may change or need to be customized for different environments or deployments. The purpose of this file is to provide a centralized location for managing and accessing these variables, making it easier to update and maintain the configuration of the project.

In the context of a software project, the `variables.tf` file plays a crucial role in defining the necessary inputs and configuration options for the various modules and resources used within the project. It allows for flexibility and customization by allowing users to easily modify the values of these variables without modifying the actual code.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use the `variables.tf` file other than having the appropriate infrastructure or configuration management tool (e.g., Terraform) installed and configured.

## Usage
To utilize the `variables.tf` file in a project, follow these steps:
1. Ensure that the appropriate infrastructure or configuration management tool is installed and configured.
2. Open the `variables.tf` file.
3. Define the desired variables by specifying their names, types, and descriptions using the following syntax:
```
variable "<variable_name>" {
    type        = <variable_type>
    description = "<variable_description>"
}
```
4. Save the file and use the defined variables in other files or modules within the project.

## Methods
The `variables.tf` file does not contain any methods or functions. It simply defines variables that can be used in other parts of the project.

## Useful details
- The `variable` block in the `variables.tf` file is used to define each variable. It includes the variable's name, type, and description.
- The `type` attribute specifies the data type of the variable (e.g., `string`, `number`, `bool`, etc.).
- The `description` attribute provides a brief description of the variable and its purpose.
- Example:
```
variable "resource_group_name" {
    type        = string
    description = "The name of resource group in which to create server"
}
```
- In this example, the variable `resource_group_name` is defined as a string type variable with a description indicating that it is used to specify the name of the resource group in which to create a server.
