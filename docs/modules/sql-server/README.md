# docs/modules/sql-server/README.md

## Overview
The `sql-server` folder contains the necessary files and content for provisioning an Azure SQL Server using Terraform. It plays a crucial role in the software project by providing the infrastructure code required to create and manage an Azure SQL Server instance.

## Usage
To utilize the `sql-server` module in your project, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have the necessary prerequisites in place.
2. Copy the contents of the `sql-server` folder into your project directory.
3. Customize the variables in the `variables.tf` file to match your desired configuration.
4. Run Terraform commands to initialize, plan, and apply the infrastructure changes.

## Useful details

### main.tf
The `main.tf` file is a Terraform configuration file that defines the infrastructure for an Azure SQL Server. It uses the `azurerm_mssql_server` resource to create and manage the SQL Server instance. This file provides the necessary infrastructure code to provision an Azure SQL Server.

### outputs.tf
The `outputs.tf` file is used to define the output values of a Terraform module. It allows users to specify the values that should be exposed after the infrastructure is provisioned. These outputs can be used by other modules or external systems.

### variables.tf
The `variables.tf` file is used for defining and declaring variables that will be used in a software project. These variables can be used to customize and configure different aspects of the project, such as resource group name, server name, administrator login credentials, etc.

Please refer to the individual files for more detailed information on their purpose and usage.
