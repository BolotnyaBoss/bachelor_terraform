# main.tf
## Overview
The `main.tf` file is a Terraform configuration file that is used to define and manage Azure SQL Server resources. It is part of a larger project that uses Terraform to provision and manage infrastructure resources on Azure. This specific file is responsible for creating an Azure SQL Server instance.

## Prerequisites
To use this file, you need to have the following dependencies:
- Terraform (version 0.12 or later)
- Azure CLI (version 2.0 or later)

## Usage
To instantiate and utilize this file in a project, follow these steps:
1. Install Terraform and Azure CLI on your local machine.
2. Create an Azure resource group for your project if it doesn't exist.
3. Create a `main.tf` file in your project directory and copy the code from above into it.
4. Set the values for the required variables (`var.server_name`, `var.location`, `var.resource_group_name`, `var.server_administrator_login`, `var.server_administrator_login_password`, `var.aad_login_username`, and `var.object_id`).
5. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to your project directory.
6. Run the following commands:
```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
7. Terraform will initialize, validate, and apply the configuration to create the Azure SQL Server instance.

## Methods
This file defines a single resource block for creating an Azure SQL Server instance. The `azurerm_mssql_server` resource represents an Azure SQL Server and has the following parameters:
- `name` (string): The name of the SQL Server instance.
- `location` (string): The Azure region where the SQL Server instance will be created.
- `resource_group_name` (string): The name of the resource group where the SQL Server instance will be created.
- `version` (string): The version of SQL Server to use.
- `administrator_login` (string): The administrator login name for the SQL Server instance.
- `administrator_login_password` (string): The administrator login password for the SQL Server instance.

The resource block also includes an `azuread_administrator` block for configuring an Azure AD administrator for the SQL Server instance. It has the following parameters:
- `login_username` (string): The username of the Azure AD administrator.
- `object_id` (string): The object ID of the Azure AD administrator.

## Useful details
- The `name`, `location`, `resource_group_name`, `administrator_login`, `administrator_login_password`, `login_username`, and `object_id` variables are not defined in this file. They should be defined either in a separate variables file or provided as command-line arguments when running Terraform commands.
- The `version` parameter in the `azurerm_mssql_server` resource block is set to "12.0" in this example. You can change it to the desired version based on your requirements.
- This file assumes that you have already authenticated with Azure CLI and have the necessary permissions to create resources in Azure.
