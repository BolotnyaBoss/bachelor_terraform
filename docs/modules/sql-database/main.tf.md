# main.tf
## Overview
The `main.tf` file is a Terraform configuration file that defines a resource for creating an Azure SQL database. This file is used as part of an infrastructure-as-code (IaC) approach to manage and provision cloud resources.

## Prerequisites
To use this file, you need to have Terraform installed on your system. Additionally, you need to have an Azure subscription and the necessary credentials (such as Azure CLI) to authenticate and access Azure resources. This code also assumes that you have already created an Azure SQL server.

## Usage
To use this file, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Terraform installed on your system.
2. Create a new directory for your Terraform project.
3. Create a new file named `main.tf` in the project directory.
4. Copy and paste the code provided into the `main.tf` file.
5. Modify the values of the variables (`var.database_name`, `var.server_id`, etc.) as per your requirements.
6. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
7. Run the following command to initialize the Terraform project:

   ```
   terraform init
   ```

8. Run the following command to create the Azure SQL database:

   ```
   terraform apply
   ```

9. Review the changes that Terraform plans to make and confirm the action by typing `yes`.

## Methods
This file defines a single resource block:

### `azurerm_mssql_database.database`
This resource block is responsible for creating an Azure SQL database. It has the following parameters:

- `name` (string): The name of the database.
- `server_id` (string): The ID of the Azure SQL server where the database will be created.
- `sku_name` (string): The pricing tier of the database. In this example, it is set to `"S0"`.
- `collation` (string): The collation setting for the database. In this example, it is set to `"SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS"`.

The resource block also includes an `import` block, which specifies the details for importing an existing database from a storage account. It has the following parameters:

- `storage_uri` (string): The URI of the storage account where the database backup is stored.
- `storage_key` (string): The access key for the storage account.
- `storage_key_type` (string): The type of access key. In this example, it is set to `"StorageAccessKey"`.
- `administrator_login` (string): The login name for the Azure SQL server administrator.
- `administrator_login_password` (string): The password for the Azure SQL server administrator.
- `authentication_type` (string): The authentication type. In this example, it is set to `"ADPassword"`.

## Useful details
- The `azurerm_mssql_database` resource block is specific to the Azure provider in Terraform. Make sure you have the appropriate provider configuration in your Terraform project.
- Ensure that the necessary Azure permissions and roles are assigned to the credentials used by Terraform to access and manage Azure resources.
- The `import` block within the `azurerm_mssql_database` resource block is optional. It allows you to import an existing database from a storage account during the creation process.
- This code assumes that you have defined the necessary variables (`var.database_name`, `var.server_id`, etc.) in a separate file or as command-line arguments. Make sure to provide the correct values for these variables when using the code.
