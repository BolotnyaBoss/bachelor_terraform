# variables.tf

## Overview
The `variables.tf` file is used to define and declare variables that will be used in a software project. These variables can be used to configure and customize different aspects of the project, such as server settings, database names, storage account details, etc. This file plays a crucial role in providing flexibility and configurability to the project.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use the `variables.tf` file. However, the file is typically used in conjunction with other configuration files or scripts in the project.

## Usage
To use the variables defined in the `variables.tf` file, you need to instantiate them in your project code or configuration files. Here's an example of how to use the variables in a Terraform configuration:

```terraform
resource "my_database_resource" {
  server_id                      = var.server_id
  database_name                  = var.database_name
  storage_account_name           = var.storage_account_name
  storage_container_name         = var.storage_container_name
  blob_filename                  = var.blob_filename
  storage_account_primary_key    = var.storage_account_primary_key
  server_administrator_login     = var.server_administrator_login
  server_administrator_password  = var.server_administrator_login_password
}
```

In the above example, the variables defined in `variables.tf` are used to configure a database resource. The values for these variables can be provided through command-line arguments, environment variables, or by directly assigning values in the configuration file.

## Variables
The `variables.tf` file defines the following variables:

- `server_id`: The id of the server in which to create the database.
- `database_name`: The name of the database to be created.
- `storage_account_name`: The name of the storage account where the bacpac file is stored.
- `storage_container_name`: The name of the storage container where the bacpac file is stored.
- `blob_filename`: The name of the bacpac file.
- `storage_account_primary_key`: The storage account primary access key.
- `server_administrator_login`: The administrator login of the server.
- `server_administrator_login_password`: The administrator login password of the server.

These variables can be customized and assigned different values based on the project requirements.

## Useful details
- The `type` parameter specifies the data type of each variable (in this case, all variables are of type `string`).
- The `description` parameter provides a brief description of each variable and its purpose.
- The values of these variables can be accessed using the `var.<variable_name>` syntax in the project code or configuration files.
