# variables.tf
## Overview
The `variables.tf` file is used to define variables that will be used in a project. It serves as a central location to declare and assign values to these variables, which can then be referenced and used throughout the project. These variables can be used to configure and customize various aspects of the project.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use the `variables.tf` file.

## Usage
To use the `variables.tf` file in a project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file in your project directory called `variables.tf`.
2. Copy the code from the example below and paste it into the `variables.tf` file.
3. Modify the variables according to your project's requirements.

Example usage:

```terraform
variable "server_id" {
    type        = string
    description = "The id of the server in which to create the database"
}

variable "database_name" {
    type        = string
    description = "The name of the database which need to create"
}

variable "storage_account_name" {
    type        = string
    description = "The name of the storage account where stored bacpac file"
}

// Additional variables...

```

## Methods
The `variables.tf` file does not contain any methods or functions. It only defines variables and their associated properties such as type and description.

## Useful details
- The `type` property of each variable defines the data type of the variable. In this case, all variables are of type `string`.
- The `description` property provides a brief description of each variable and its purpose.
- These variables can be referenced and used in other Terraform configuration files within the same project. For example, you can use the `server_id` variable in a resource block to specify the server ID where a database will be created:

```terraform
resource "database" "example" {
    server_id     = var.server_id
    database_name = var.database_name

    // Additional configuration...
}
```

- The `variables.tf` file can be used to store and manage project-specific configuration values, making it easier to customize and maintain your Terraform code.
