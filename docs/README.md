## Overview
The `/docs` folder is a crucial part of the project documentation. It provides high-level information about the purpose and structure of the code within the project. This folder contains various subfolders and files that play important roles in the software project's development and deployment.

## Usage
To utilize the `/docs` folder in your project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `/docs` folder.
3. Read the README.md file to understand the purpose and functionality of each component.
4. Use the information provided in the README.md file to effectively integrate the code into your larger project.

## Useful details
Here are some additional details that may be helpful to you as you explore the `/docs` folder:

- The `/docs/modules` subfolder contains documentation for different modules used in the project. Each module has its own README.md file explaining its purpose, usage, and any specific instructions or considerations.

- The `main.tf` file is used to define and configure various resources in an Azure infrastructure project. It is written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) and is used by Terraform to provision and manage the infrastructure. This file serves as the backbone of the project, defining the infrastructure components required for the software to function.

- The `variables.tf` file defines the variables that will be used throughout the project. These variables can be customized based on the specific requirements of the project. It provides a central location to define and manage variables, making it easier to configure and adapt the project as needed.

- The `outputs.tf` file is responsible for defining and declaring the outputs of the infrastructure resources provisioned using Terraform. It helps provide visibility into the resources created and allows for easy access to important information about the infrastructure.

By following the instructions and referring to the provided documentation, you can effectively understand and utilize the code within the `/docs` folder in your software project.
