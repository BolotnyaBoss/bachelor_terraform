# /docs/README.md

## Overview
The `docs` folder is an essential component of this software project. It serves as a central location for all project documentation, providing developers and users with a comprehensive understanding of the project's purpose, functionality, and structure.

## Usage
To utilize the `docs` folder effectively, developers and users should familiarize themselves with the different subfolders and files it contains. The `modules` subfolder, for example, contains documentation for various modules within the project, providing insights into their purpose, structure, and usage.

## Useful details
- The `modules` subfolder is particularly important, as it provides documentation for the different modules present in the project. It includes subfolders for each module, such as `data-factory` and `resource-group`, containing relevant files like `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf`.
- The `main.tf` file within each module subfolder defines the main configuration for that specific module. It outlines the resources, configurations, and settings associated with the module.
- The `variables.tf` file within each module subfolder defines the input variables required for the module. These variables allow users to customize and tailor the module's behavior to suit their specific needs.
- The `outputs.tf` file within each module subfolder defines the outputs generated by the module. These outputs can be used by other modules or external components to access and utilize the resources created by the module.

By leveraging the documentation within the `docs` folder, developers and users can gain a deeper understanding of the project, its purpose, and its components. This knowledge will enable them to effectively utilize and contribute to the project's success.
