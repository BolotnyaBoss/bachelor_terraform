# variables.tf
## Overview
The `variables.tf` file is used to define variables that can be used throughout the project. These variables are used to store and manage different configurations and settings for the project. The purpose of this file is to provide a central location for defining and managing these variables, making it easier to update and maintain the project.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use the `variables.tf` file.

## Usage
To use the `variables.tf` file, you can simply define the variables and their respective values in your project configuration. These variables can then be accessed and used throughout the project. Here is an example of how to define and use the variables in a Terraform configuration:

```terraform
# variables.tf

variable "resource_group_name" {
    type        = string
    description = "The name of resource group in which to create storage account"
}

variable "location" {
    type        = string
    description = "The location where create storage account"
}

...
```

```terraform
# main.tf

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
    name                     = var.storage_account_name
    resource_group_name      = var.resource_group_name
    location                 = var.location
    ...
}
```

In the above example, the variables defined in `variables.tf` are used to configure an Azure Storage Account resource in the `main.tf` file.

## Methods
The `variables.tf` file does not contain any methods or functions. It only contains variable definitions.

## Useful details
- The `type` field in each variable definition specifies the data type of the variable. In this case, all variables are of type `string`.
- The `description` field provides a brief description of each variable, explaining its purpose and usage.
- The variables defined in `variables.tf` can be referenced using the `var` prefix, followed by the variable name. For example, `var.resource_group_name` references the value of the `resource_group_name` variable.
- The values of these variables can be set in a separate configuration file or passed as command-line arguments when executing the project.
