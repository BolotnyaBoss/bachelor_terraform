# variables.tf
## Overview
The `variables.tf` file is used to define variables that are used in a software project. These variables can be used to pass values to different modules or resources within the project. The purpose of this file is to provide a centralized location to define and manage these variables.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use the `variables.tf` file.

## Usage
To use the variables defined in the `variables.tf` file, you can reference them in other Terraform configuration files using the syntax `var.<variable_name>`. For example, if you want to use the `resource_group_name` variable, you can use it like this:

```terraform
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = var.resource_group_name
  location = var.location
}
```

## Methods
There are no methods or functions in the `variables.tf` file. It only contains variable definitions.

## Useful details
- Each variable in the `variables.tf` file has a defined `type` which specifies the expected data type of the variable.
- The `description` field provides a brief description of the purpose or usage of each variable.
- Variables can be used to pass values between different modules or resources within a Terraform project.
- The values of these variables can be set either directly in the `variables.tf` file or passed as command line arguments when running Terraform commands.
